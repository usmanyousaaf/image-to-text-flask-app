# Image-to-Text Flask App

A simple **Flask** application that allows users to upload images and extract text using Optical Character Recognition (**OCR**). This app is perfect for digitizing printed content, scanned documents, business cards, or any image-based text into machine-readable text.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload images to extract text.
- **OCR Integration**: Utilizes the **Tesseract OCR** engine to perform text extraction.
- **Easy-to-use**: A user-friendly web interface built with **Flask**.
- **Fast and Accurate**: Reliable text extraction from images in real time.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications.
- **Tesseract OCR**: An open-source OCR engine for converting images into editable text.
- **HTML/CSS**: Front-end to create a simple and clean user interface for uploading images and displaying results.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usmanyousaaf/image-to-text-flask-app.git
cd image-to-text-flask-app
```

## Install the required Python libraries:

## Download Tesseract OCR from Tesseract at UB Mannheim (for Windows).
```bash
Install Tesseract and note the installation path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).
```
## Set the Tesseract executable path in your app.py:
```bash
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```
##Running the Application
- Start the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```

Access the app: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the image-to-text converter.

## Features
